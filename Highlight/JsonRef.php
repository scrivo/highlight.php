/**
 * Class to decode JSON data that contains path-based references.
 *
 * The language data file for highlight.js are written as JavaScript classes
 * and therefore may contain variables. This allows for inner references in
 * the language data. This kind of data can be converterd to JSON using the
 * path based references. This class can be used to decode such JSON
 * structures. It follows the conventions for path based referencing as
 * used in dojox.json.ref form the Dojo toolkit (Javascript). A typical
 * example of such a structure is as follows:
 *
 * {
 *   "name":"Kris Zyp",
 *   "children":[{"name":"Jennika Zyp"},{"name":"Korban Zyp"}],
 *   "spouse":{
 *     "name":"Nicole Zyp",
 *     "spouse":{"$ref":"#"},
 *     "children":{"$ref":"#children"}
 *   },
 *   "oldestChild":{"$ref":"#children.0"}
 * }
 *
 * Usage example:
 *
 * $jr = new JsonRef();
 * $data = $jr->decode(file_get_contents("data.json"));
 * echo $data->spouse->spouse->name; // echos 'Kris Zyp'
 * echo $data->oldestChild->name; // echos 'Jennika Zyp'
